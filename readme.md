## Features
I'm somewhat of an indecisive person, so in the past year or so I've been going back and forth between neovim (+ tmux) and emacs. In the repository also includes doom emacs and vscode configuration files.

## Keyboard
If the key bindings might seem strange it's probably because I use the [Ergodox](https://www.ergodox.io/) keyboard with the [Dvorak](https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/) layout. Here's a view:
